## Abstract

After collecting some research papers and talking to students,
it is observed that there is a need for a software that helps students 
plan their study schedule as well as to keep all their deadlines in check.

This application aims at helping the users to plan their entire schedule for exams 
and for completing any tasks within a certain amount of time. 

This will save the user’s time of maintaining a schedule manually and the reminders feature ensures they don’t forget any tasks and prevents them from missing any deadline.

The analytics feature will give an overview of their daily, weekly and monthly progress, completed and pending tasks, hence making sure the user completes their goals  on time.

This application will ensure effective use of the student’s valuable time and boost their productivity, which will improve their performance and help them thrive in their academics.

## Problem Definition

A student's life is always busy with numerous assignments,
tests, and projects. With too many things to keep track of, it becomes stressful to battle the deadlines and simultaneously manage a study schedule for upcoming tests.
  
It is thus quite a task to prepare an ideal study schedule and keep up with the deadlines. 

StudyMate will help the students to plan their studies and set daily,
weekly and monthly goals and ensure that they complete them by giving regular reminders.

The application will be very useful for students to keep track of all the academic data.

## Objectives

The main objective of this application would be to aid users plan their study schedules and keep track of all their academic goals.  
The planner will help them manage their time effectively and ensure they don't miss any deadlines by giving them frequent reminders.
The user can check their progress by visiting the Analytics section. The pie chart feature will display a detailed analysis of how much work has been completed so far and how much work is pending, by displaying all the information subject-wise and goal-wise as set by the student.
This will hence result in increased productivity and therefore help improve the student’s overall academic performance.

To make an app "Studymate" having the following features:-

- **To plan a study timetable.**

- **To store all study-related material subject-wise in one place.**

- **To set up reminders of daily tasks and important dates using google calendar.**

- **To keep a track of study progress using a planner.**

- **To get a weekly subject-wise study progress report and analysis.**

## Scope

The prime objective of this application will be aimed at improving the user’s ability to manage time by planning weekly and monthly tasks in advance. 

This application will mainly be useful for students to keep track of their academics or anyone else from the working class to manage their daily, weekly, and monthly goals. 

This app will be extremely useful for people who need a little helping hand when it comes to utilizing their time effectively, as it has a planning feature which the user can use to plan everything in advance and hence avoid missing any deadline which can tend to happen when they have too much on their plate.

Everything is in one place and just a fingertip away; users can use this app to keep their notes in an organized manner and manage their documents very effectively in the app itself.

## Existing System/Project

This application will predominantly be a reminder app with an easy-to-use user interface.
The goals set by the user will be linked to their google calendar for easy access. 
**After researching similar applications available for the same purpose, we realized that none of these existing systems had a feature to link the tasks to the google calendar, add notes and display detailed analysis of completed and pending work in one application.**
